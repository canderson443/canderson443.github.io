<div style="color:white; text-align:center;" id="LayoutDiv10"><h3>Although there are many theories about alien presence at Area 51, there are many who believe that it is just a hoax. In reality, there has not been any hard evidence that proves the existence of extraterrestrial life within the facility. There really is no possible way of knowing until the government releases the truth about Area 51. Alien conspiracies are merely just common folklore theories made up purely for entertainment. It has not even been proven that aliens exist at all, so it seems unrealistic that the government would be hiding such an incident. All of the cases that believers appeal to are only based upon the word of theorists, and most, if not all evidence provided by people who believe is speculated information. As far as anybody is concerned, Area 51's sole purpose is for the designing and testing of United States Air Force equipment. Just because the details of Area 51 are kept top-secret does not mean that the government is hiding secrets as drastic as the presence of alien life.</h3></div>
