  <h1><strong>Aliens Exist at Area 51</strong></h1>
</div>

<div style="color:white; text-align:center; width:910px;" id="LayoutDiv10"><h3>There are many people who believe that Area 51 has captivity over extraterrrestrial life and alien spacecraft. In fact, there are many claims to cases that link Area 51 with the testing and biopsy of unidentified figures and other unknown objects. What makes the situation even more suspicious is that the government has revealed very little about what exists and what does not within the facility, and it is neither confirmed nor denied whether or not the government is in fact keeping alien life there. Over the years, theorists have developed numerous conspiracies about alien presence, and many have worked to find the most detailed links between Area 51 and aliens. An example of this can be seen below: </h3></div>

<div style="text-align:center; color:white;" id="LayoutDiv14"><h3>In July of 1947, the remains of an unknown flying object were discovered on a ranch in Roswell New Mexico. It was said by reporters that it seemed to be the shrapnel from a "flying disk", and the material seemed to be unknown to everyone. The remains were taken by the governemnt for further investigation, and it is said that they brouht it back to area 51 for testing and diagnostics. The government never really explained what it was or what happened to it, and they only indicated that it could have been a surveillance balloon. However, many thoerists and several others have come forward to state that unknown life forms were taken from the scene of the crash.  </h3></div>
