<div style="color:white; text-align:center;" id="LayoutDiv10"><h3> I believe that there are, or has been, a particular level of alien presence within the confines of the Area 51 facility. To me, there is no doubt that aliens exist; It does not seem likely that our uncomprehendablly enormous universe is only inhabited by humans. As for Area 51, I believe that it is definitely quite possible that the government is testing some form of extraterrestrial life or technology. However, I personally don't view this alien presence in the conventional way that others do. While popel may think of the generic "bobble headed" humanoid, I feel that the aliens really being studied are small unknown specimen, such as an unidentified form of bacteria from another planet. I do not know for a fact that anything that I believe is true, but as a scientist and man of curiosity, I am genuinly hoping that there really are aliens at Area 51. Although there may not be a lot of valid evidence to support this, I still maintain the thought of an alien species among us on earth.</h3></div>
