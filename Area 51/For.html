<div id="LayoutDiv4"><h3>There are many theories out there that state that Area 51 clearly has custody over extraterrestrial life. Many people have claimed that the government has brought both alien life forms and UFO's to the Area 51 facility for study and biopsy. It is no secret that there have definitely been unusual sightings around the facility itself. What makes it all the more suspicious is that the government has kept the topic extremely classified, and it they have neither confirmed nor denied extraterrestrial presence there. There are several cases people have used to prove that there Area 51 really does have aliens. </h3></div>

<div id="LayoutDiv6"><h3>Roswell New Meixico UFO Sighting</h3></div>

<div id="LayoutDiv7">In July of 1947, mysterious shrapnel and other remains of strange metal were discovered on a ranch in New Meixco. An investigation was lead following the discovery, findign that the metal appeared to be part of a "flying disk". No one was able to identify what it was. United States military took the remains back to Area 51 for study. Years later, the goverment claimed that the shrapnel was merely just the remains of a servaillence balloon. However, many theorists found there own evidence and conspiracies that extraterrestrial life had really been taken from the crash sight and brought back to Area 51. </div>
